# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
To develop code that meets the criteria of being maintainable, readable, and adaptable it is important to think of use cases going into other projects. Does the code allow for simple changes that could make it useful in other projects? If it doesnâ€™t than important to ask yourself; what can be refactored to make it useful in other projects? For readability it is important to stick with industry standards for naming and formatting while commenting code that may be unclear at first glance. 

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I try and approach every problem with uncovering a number of possible issues/solutions and methodically going through each one till a resolution is found. In the case of Grazioso Salvare I looked at what was being asked and how I could achieve these asks more effectively. This approach differs in the manner of being guided on what to create. The past projects had a level of improvisation to them while this one I had to execute the customers vision. In this class we had an emphasis on using CRUD development and I would like to maintain those techniques while adapting them for other projects. 

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

 In the simplest form our jobs as computer scientists is to
make it easier for people to operate a computer by manipulating data in such a
way that makes it easier to understand. For example, in this project we needed
to take data from a database and input it into a data table while providing
other information like a pie chart and a map widget.
